### React Features in TaskWhiz:



#### useState:

- We use useState to manage tasks and their status. The app tracks tasks in an array and the current status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed).



#### useEffect:

- Loading Data from LocalStorage: On page load, we use useEffect to retrieve stored tasks from localStorage (if any) and set them as the initial state.

- Saving Data to LocalStorage: Whenever a task is added or deleted, we update localStorage to persist the tasks across sessions.



#### LocalStorage Persistence:

- TaskWhiz automatically saves your tasks in localStorage so that when you reload the page, all your tasks remain intact. You no longer need to worry about losing your progress.
